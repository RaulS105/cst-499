                                    <strong>The best way to prevent illness</strong> is to avoid being exposed to the virus and to get vaccinated. In addition, the CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. They include:

                                    Wash your hands often with plain soap and water. The CDC recommends 
                                    washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, 
                                    especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, 
                                    coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends 
                                    using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.
                                    <br>

                                    <strong>Cover your mouth and nose</strong> with a mask when around others. Find more information about how to select, wear, and clean your mask.

                                    Get the COVID-19 vaccine. When you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.

                                    Follow CDC guidance on large gatherings, social distancing and mask wearing, based on if you are fully vaccinated or not.

                                        The FDA is dedicated to providing timely guidelines to enhance pandemic response activities.
                                        For the period of the public health emergency, the FDA is providing this guideline to establish a policy to help speed the availability of

                                        Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 cases in the United States need widespread testing in order to stop the spread of this fast spreading, serious sickness.

                                        Nose swabbing is a common tool to use for testing for Sars-CoV-2. Going to a local doctor or pharmacy can give you results for covid in 1-2 days time.
